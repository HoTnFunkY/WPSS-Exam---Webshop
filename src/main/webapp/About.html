    <h2>What we are about</h2>
    <h3>Our vision - AI everywhere advancing humankind.</h3>
    <p>
        <p>Our main goal is. To Provides an operational AI platform for producing real-world AI applications at scale and at speed. It’s user-friendly, intuitive and end-to-end.</p>

        AI is the most transformative technology of this century.
        Every positive leap for mankind has been fueled by intelligence - technical revolutions as well as achievements in sustainability, business or democracy.
        Now with the advent of AI we give ourselves the opportunity to massively expand out intelligence.
        Our lives are already being dramatically improved by the technology. From healthcare to transportation, from weather predictions to preventing crop diseases.
        But that’s just the start. AI will enable businesses and organisations to provide context and understanding for what can seem like random connections.
        AI allows for the cross-pollination of businesses and processes across industries. It creates new, faster, better, more efficient ways of what we are already doing
        and finds new ways to solve real-world problems.
        It’s fueling a new pace of innovation that will, and is, advancing humankind. That’s why we believe in the good of AI.</p>
    <h2>What is AI</h2>
    <h3>Artificial intelligence </h3>
    <p>
        AI sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural
        intelligence displayed by humans and other animals.
        In computer science AI research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its
        environment and takes actions that maximize its chance
        of successfully achieving its goals.[1] Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a
        machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds,
        such as "learning" and "problem solving".[2]

    <p>The scope of AI is disputed: as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring "intelligence" are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the AI effect,
        leading to the quip, "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet."[3][citation not found] For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from "artificial intelligence",
        having become a routine technology.[4] Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech,[5] competing at the highest level
        in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go),[6] autonomously operating cars, and intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations.</p>

    <p>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,[7][8] followed by disappointment and the loss
        of funding (known as an "AI winter"),[9][10] followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.[8][11] For most of its history, AI research has been divided into subfields
        that often fail to communicate with each other.[12] These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"),
        [13] the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences.[14][15][16] Subfields have also been based on social factors
        (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).[12]</p>

    <p>The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to
        move and manipulate objects.[13] General intelligence is among the field's long-term goals.[17] Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI.
        Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics.
        The AI field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many others.</p>

    <p>The field was founded on the claim that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".[18] This raises philosophical arguments
        about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence which are issues that have been explored by myth,
        fiction and philosophy since antiquity.[19] Some people also consider AI to be a danger to humanity if it progresses unabated.[20] Others believe that AI,
        unlike previous technological revolutions, will create a risk of mass unemployment.[21]</p>

    <p>In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding;
        and AI techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science, software engineering and operations research.[22][11]</p>
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <h3>Our mission - to make AI technology useable and affordable for all</h3>
    <p>
        In 2006, we launched our first product, Synapse, a Windows-based tool to help organisations design and train neural networks. Working closely with hundreds of businesses gave us a wealth of insight into how AI and deep learning could be used practically to solve real-world problems.

        We also learnt a lot about the barriers that prevented most organisations from using AI: the skills needed were very scarce, and therefore very expensive, and the technical and infrastructure requirements were extremely complex.

        This problem remains. Although we have now many more tools, some of which are free and open-sourced. But for AI to be useable to the many it needs to be able to solve real-world problems.

        It must be made operational. That is, usable and affordable.</p>
